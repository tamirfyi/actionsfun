# Name your workflow
name: events-and-triggers-workflow

# Define event triggers
# - events can originate from github
# - events can also run on a schedule
# - events can be triggered via a REST API

# A job is a set of steps in a workflow executed on the same runner
# - each step is either a shell script or action
# - steps are executed in order and depend on each other
# by default they have no dependencies and run in parallel
# - can share data from one step to another (using needs: <job name>)
